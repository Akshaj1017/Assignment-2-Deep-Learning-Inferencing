# Assignment-2-Deep-Learning-Inferencing

# Objective
Detect and locate tables inside a page using DNN, then parse the table to extract a dataframe that should not lose any information and structure of the table. The output should be an excel file containing the extracted table.
The solution should be a general solution that can work on different pages of different PDFs.
